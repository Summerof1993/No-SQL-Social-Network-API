# No-SQL-Social-Network-API
Social Network API with NoSQL

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to create a backend API for a Social Network Application using MongoDB as the database and Mongoose JS as the DRM (Document Relational Mapping) and Express JS as the server. The API contains two models( User and Thought) and one Schema that's used as a subdocument in the Thought model. This backend API could easily be linked to a front end interface to build a full-stack application. 

## Installation

In order to be able to use the Social Network API, the user can download the code to their local environment and use Insomnia or PostMan
to make HTTP requests to test out the endpoints for the API. User must have Express JS and Mongo DB and Mongoose JS set up on their local machine to be able to use the application.
